# Refactoring Plan: Separation of Concerns & Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines a phased approach to tackle two critical areas of technical debt:

1. **Duplication & Separation of Concerns**  
2. **Documentation, Onboarding & Testing Hygiene**  

By addressing these, we will decouple UI from business logic, eliminate redundant code, and improve developer experience with clear docs and testing scaffolding.

---

## Objectives

- Decouple UI components from underlying business logic and shared state  
- Consolidate duplicated logic into reusable modules/hooks  
- Establish clear project documentation and architecture guides  
- Introduce linting, formatting, and smoke tests for quality hygiene

---

## Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Business Logic Extraction & Duplication Removal

- Identify duplicated logic across components (e.g., prompt formatting, error handling, state transitions).
- Consolidate shared functionality into utility modules under `client/src/utils/` or dedicated custom hooks.
- Refactor components (e.g., `VoiceInputBar`, `MessageList`, `ChatInterface`) to consume these utilities instead of inline code.
- Validate consistency by ensuring existing behaviors remain unchanged via manual smoke tests.

### Phase 2: Documentation, Onboarding & Testing Hygiene

- Develop or update high-level architecture diagrams and component responsibilities in `docs/`.
- Expand `README.md` with sections on configuration, coding standards, and project structure.
- Define and enforce lint rules and formatting guidelines (ESLint, Prettier).
- Introduce lightweight smoke tests or snapshots for critical flows (config loading, context initialization, utils behavior).

## Timeline & Milestones

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1     | 2 weeks  | Shared utilities extracted, duplicated code removed |
| 2     | 1 week   | Updated docs, onboarding materials, smoke tests |

---

## Success Metrics

- â‰¥80% reuse of extracted utilities/services across refactored components  
- Complete high-level documentation covering architecture, config, and component roles  
- Lint and formatting violations reduced to zero  
- Smoke tests reliably validate core flows with pass rate of 100%
